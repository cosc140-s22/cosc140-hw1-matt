 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?
 The homework was a good introduction to the languages. The only change I'd make is the use of links since that was particularly tricky and I feel as though we need a little more practice in that regard.

S

Well done.  Nicely constructed recap of the first excursion and other places!
